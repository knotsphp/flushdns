## üìö Use in command line

You can also use this library in the command line by using the `flushdns` command.

It's recommended to install the library globally to use it in the command line.
```bash
composer global require knotsphp/flushdns
```

Then you can use the `flushdns` command to get the public IP address of the current machine.
```bash
# In your project directory
vendor/bin/flushdns

# Globally installed
flushdns
```

## üìñ Documentation
This library is compatible with MacOS, Linux, and Windows.

Some operating systems may require root access to flush the DNS cache.
